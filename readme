Multi-Users-System

Hi!

This project provide a general layer of common basic multi-users system like create/delete etc of new users . 

It’s can be used for primary layer to any app.

It’s written with Java, currently in the core-console version.

It’s talking with MongoDB , but the API is pretty simple, and you can change it to another DB as you wish, by implementing the interface .

For running this version you need Java and Mongo running in background. 

Run the class : 
src\main\java\execution\RunProgram.java

For change setting like DB name and global settings check the package : 
src/main/java/system/constants
